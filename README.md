# QiPRNG *(pronounced "chee"-PRNG)*
A DT**Q**W-**i**nspired **PRNG**. The output sequence is a string of the least significant bits from the measurement probabilities corresponding to a DTQW determined by an arbitrary Hamiltonian. The construction of the DTQW follows Childs' 2010 paper [On the relationship between continuous-and discrete-time quantum walk](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00220-009-0930-1).
